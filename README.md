# Verlet3D - 3D Basic Physics Engine with Verlet Integration
3D Physics Engine with Verlet Integration, based on my 2D version. 
Optimised with numpy to update all objects in parallel.
* Up/down arrow keys to zoom in/out
* Right/left arrow keys to rotate
* Click, drag, release to add new objects
* Hold space to slow everything down (if things go crazy fast)
* Hold 'N' to spam-spawn objects at mouse pointer
